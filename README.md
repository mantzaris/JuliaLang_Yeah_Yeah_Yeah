# Julia Lang is such a great programming language

Most of this repository holds jupyter notebooks showcasing, in a tutorial manner, how we can do cool things with Julia. Because Julia is a clear language we can also show how implementing some ML/computational analytics becomes more clear as a result of working with Julia. Choose any topic you like because most of the notebooks are self contained and syntax is introduced along the way. *(Yes, there may be redundant overlap between notebooks, but that is just a way of reinforcing the basics which is rarely a bad idea)*
